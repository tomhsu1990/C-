/*
1. static_cast
It works for any type, as long as the type conversion is defined for that type

 No checks are performed during runtime to guarantee that the object being converted is in fact a full object of the destination type. 
 Therefore, it is up to the programmer to ensure that the conversion is safe.
 it does not incur the overhead of the type-safety checks of dynamic_cast.

2. dynamic_cast
dynamic_cast can only be used with pointers and references to classes (or with void*). 
Its purpose is to ensure that the result of the type conversion points to a valid complete object of the destination pointer type.

// b. run-time type check. If succeed, py==pd; if fail, py==0. (For reference cast, if fail, throw bad_cast exception)
// c. It requires the 2 types to be polymorphic (have virtual function)

3. const_cast
cast away the constness
// a. only work with pointer/reference
// b. only work on the same type

// Generally C++ styple of cast are preferred over the C-style, because:
// 1. Easier to identify in the code
// 2. Less usage error. C++ style provides:
//      a. Narrowly specified purpose of each cast,
//      b. Run-tim type check capability.
